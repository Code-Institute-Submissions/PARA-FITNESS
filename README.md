        -   I've used subtle, pastel colours mainly, that are not harsh, but still colourful enough to catch your attention.
    -   #### Typography
        -   I've used Roboto, Exo and Jura fonts throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
            I've found these 3 fonts complimenting each other well.
